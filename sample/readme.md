## Sample chat application using Tanka GraphQL 

A simple chat application based on web api using  [Tanka GraphQL execution library](https://github.com/pekkah/tanka-graphql) based server using [ASP.NET Core SignalR .NET Client](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/dotnet-client?view=aspnetcore-2.2). The sample application provides a crude demonstration how to work with both with the server side and with the tanka-graphql-net-client  library (this repository) in WPF client. 

The client uses MVVM pattern to separate the logic from the UI and the core of the application is implemented as a .NET Standard 2.0 library.
